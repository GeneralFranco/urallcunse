# CSV_Sanitiser
Some scripts I have created, gathered and modified. Python and Powershell

CSV_Sanitiser (I am not American so I spell stuff like the rest of the English speaking countries #joke)

Needed one for work but could not find anything that worked for me. 
There is the Source, CSV-Sanitiser, opens GUi, select the CSV using the GUI, select the columns you want included in the sanitised version,
Select the Search and choose the Column you want to search, so if the column header is 'Location', select the column 'Location'
form the list that populates, one one entry per search box, you cna apply multiple searches on multiple columns, then 
select the output folder and the name you wish to call the sanitised file. It is very quick and very capable, enjoy!
You can also select to conatin the search query or not contain, so oyu can filter out keywords or show the results.
